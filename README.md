# Dogs vs Cats Classifier 🐶🐱

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **Dogs vs Cats Image Classifier** using deep learning. The model is trained to distinguish between images of dogs and cats with high accuracy.

## 📌 Features

* Data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
* Model building using **TensorFlow / Keras**
* Training with validation
* Accuracy and loss visualization
* Prediction on custom images

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas


## 📊 Results

* Training and validation accuracy/loss curves are plotted.
* Final model achieves good performance on unseen images.
* Example predictions included inside the notebook.
